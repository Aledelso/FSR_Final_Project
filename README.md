Execution Instructions To run the simulation, make sure all the files are in the same folder, in particular:

UAM_centrlized.slx (or UAM_decentrlized.slx)

UAM_initialization.m (the initialization script)

Once the files are in the same folder, open the UAM_centrlized.slx model (or UAM_decentrlized.slx) and start the simulation.
